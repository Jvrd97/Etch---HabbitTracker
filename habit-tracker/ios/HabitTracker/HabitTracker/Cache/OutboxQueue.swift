// [review:need-review] PHASE-01/12-ios-offline-queue
// summary: offline outbox for POST /entries — PendingEntry model + OutboxStore (in-memory + SwiftData), OutboxQueue that enqueues on connectivity failure and flushes in order (delete-after-success — at-most-once only while the network is fully absent; see flush() note on the ack-loss window), and an NWPathMonitor-backed auto-flush wiring
